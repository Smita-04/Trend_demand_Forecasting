# Trend_demand_Forecasting
Project Overview:
Demand forecasting is an estimate of sales during a specified future period based on the proposed marketing plan and a set of particular uncontrollable and competitive force
Goals: 
Accurate demand forecasting serves as the cornerstone of business success, wielding its influence across a multitude of operational facets. The ability to predict future consumer preferences and market trends empowers organizations to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and maintain a competitive edge

 Load essential libraries for data processing and model building.
Import dataset for analysis.
The data structure and content were analyzed to identify patterns and anomalies
The relationships between the features are calculated
 highly correlated features to improve the model accuracy.
Transform skewed data for normalization
Convert categorical data into a numerical format.
The data were divided into training and testing sets.
Standardize data for consistent model performance.
Development of a predictive model using training data.
Assessment of model performance using evaluation metrics.
Different models are compared to identify the best performer.
Optimizing parameters for Random Forest and XGBoost models.
The most accurate model should be stored for future use.
Save scaling parameters for deployment consistency.
Apply saved scaling during the prediction.
Transform the user data for model compatibility.
The model was used to make real-time predictions based on user input.

# Conclusions
The firms could employ an ML-based approach to forecast the demand for achieving a higher level of accuracy. We showed that the higher level of demand forecast accuracy translates into both improved operational and financial performance outcomes
Forecasting the impact of sudden change in demand can help businesses understand the potential implications of any external factors that may influence their operations. This knowledge can be used to develop strategies that allow businesses to remain competitive and respond quickly to sudden changes in demand.
